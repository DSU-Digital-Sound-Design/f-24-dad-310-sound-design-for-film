- The entire sound and dialogue were reproduced in post-production. 
- The edited sound effects and Foley tell the story and provide insight into characters.
- Scene Plot Summary:
  - Three men appear at a train station and proceed to wait. Their movements are slow and deliberate, accompanied by distinct Foley sounds, such as footsteps on a wooden floor and flapping dustcoats.
  - One man (Jack Elam) fights with a fly, smashing it with his pistol barrel, and the Foley highlights his calm and patience.
  - Another man (Woody Strode) lets water drip from his hat into his mouth, emphasizing the slowness and heat of the day.
  - The third man (Al Mulock) runs his hands through a water trough, signaling their "bad guy" demeanor. 
  - They wait for a train, and a creaking windmill sound adds to the eerie atmosphere.
  - As the train leaves, Charles Bronson's character is revealed through the sound of his harmonica, signaling his presence.
  - Dialogue and gunfire follow, propelling the story forward.
- Director **Sergio Leone** preferred to replace all sounds in post-production, adding a stylized, artificial quality to the audio, which became an integral part of his storytelling.
- Italian Foley artist **Marco Ciorba** shared that his father Aldo worked on Leone's films, and Foley artists often visited the sets to observe actors and surfaces for realistic sound design.

## Foley and inner turmoil

Sound Design Elements:
- Naturalistic Foley: The sound of cups clinking, people shuffling, chairs moving, and other typical café noises are carefully crafted to feel authentic, emphasizing the normalcy of the environment.
- Emotional Contrast: While the setting is lively and ordinary, Anders is emotionally distant. The café sounds grow more intrusive, symbolizing his disconnection from life.
- Layering of Dialogue: Various conversations in the background are layered together, creating an immersive soundscape. The increasing volume and the overlapping nature of the dialogue reflect Anders' growing sense of being overwhelmed by the world around him.
- Absence of Music: There is no musical score, which draws attention to the natural sounds and the emotional tension of the moment. This silence heightens the realism and isolation.

## Practical Foley design

- Categories of Foley:
  - Moves (cloth sound)
  - Footsteps
  - Specifics (props)

{{% note %}}
- Foley is recorded in layers within a DAW like Reaper.
- Despite advances in technology, human-performed Foley remains irreplaceable for realism.
- Experienced Foley artists discern what should be heard and what should be ignored, focusing the sound on key elements of the scene rather than cluttering it.
- As technology allows for more options in shorter spans of time, Foley artists must prioritize essential sounds.

## Moves

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SUcALp4avE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
- Cloth sound helps bring characters to life and build intimacy.
- Smooths over edits in dialogue tracks.
- Cloth Foley should be subtle; its absence would be noticed by the audience.
- Requires careful editing to sync with movement and remove unwanted sounds.
- Moves are often the first pass of a Foley artist, allowing the entire character's movements to be captured.
- Cotton and denim are favored due to their natural sound, while synthetic fabrics may sound scratchy or clicky.

## Steps

{{% note %}}
- Steps define a character further: shoe choice and walking style reveal personality and mood.
- Foley artists use a heel-toe technique to create distinct sounds for each step, sometimes adding a slide or shuffle.
- Artists must wear soft clothes (usually cotton) to minimize unwanted noise during performance.
