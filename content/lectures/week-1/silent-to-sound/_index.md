- The introduction of sound in films added layers of realism and emotional depth to narratives.
- "Citizen Kane" uses ambient sounds like the howling wind to create a more immersive environment.
- This use of sound makes the world of the film feel tangible, pulling the audience deeper into the story.

Key Elements of the Scene:
- The Setting: The scene begins with young Charles Kane playing outside in the snow, unaware of the life-changing decision being made inside the house.
- The Characters: Inside, his mother, Mary Kane, his father, and Mr. Thatcher, a wealthy banker, discuss Charles's future. Mary Kane has decided to send Charles away to live with Mr. Thatcher, who will raise him and manage the fortune Charles is set to inherit from a mine that unexpectedly became very valuable.
- The Atmosphere: The cold, wintry setting outside contrasts with the emotionally cold decision being made inside. The howling wind heard through the windows enhances the scene's sense of isolation and inevitability.
- The Decision: Mary Kane is resolute in her decision, believing it will provide Charles with a better life. Mr. Kane, however, is more hesitant, concerned about losing control over his son. Ultimately, Mr. Thatcher is handed legal guardianship of Charles, marking the start of the boy's journey towards wealth and power—but also his eventual loneliness and despair.
- Cinematic Techniques: The scene uses deep focus cinematography, which allows viewers to see both the conversations inside and young Charles playing outside simultaneously, emphasizing the disconnect between his innocence and the adult world’s decisions.

- **Final Scene**: At the end of the movie, the camera pans through Kane's massive collection of belongings, which are being sorted and discarded after his death. In a moment of revelation, the camera zooms in on a simple wooden sled being thrown into a furnace.

The burning of the sled signifies the destruction of the last remnant of his childhood and the ultimate futility of his pursuits.
- **Cinematic Techniques**: The use of shadows, deep focus, and the ominous music in this scene creates a sense of melancholy and finality, underscoring the tragic nature of Kane’s life.
