About sound designer Skip Lievsay.

We learn that sounds used in the film are not always literal records of the object. The sound of a tape deck sounded to the designers like sci-fi alien sounds. This is probably related to associations from growing up and hearing those sounds being used in those films.

There’s a lot of conditioning happening in sound design. You have to do what the viewer is going to expect, or it will sound wrong.

> The examples given in the story are

- sound of rain—frying bacon
- cars’ engines revving—lion roars and car engines

> What are some of the films Leivsay has worked on?

- Gravity, Goodfellas, Silence of the Lambs, Do the Right Thing
- Fargo, Barton Fink, The Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men
- Every Cohen Bros film

> Check out the scene from the end of No Country for Old Men: [Amazon.com: No Country for Old Men : Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Cormac McCarthy, Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Scott Rudin, Ethan Coen, Joel Coen: Filme & TV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0RSHTSPI14PQCPKAMGZP8TA0Q5)



> Why do the Cohen's start sound design so early?

> What happens when a film goes into pre-production?

- reels of 20 minutes long
- picture editing, color correction
- then hand off to the sound supervisor who oversees
  - sound design - the creation and selection of the sounds that make up each scene, and the development of a cohesive aural aesthetic for a movie.
  - editing
  - mixing - taking sounds created by the designers and editors and integrating them in each scene so that everything sounds “natural” – in other words, making sure the sound of the butterfly landing on the hood of the car isn’t louder than the car backfiring.

> Describe these three processes

> What are the four sonic elements a sound editor will divide audio recordings into?

- dialogue
- effects
- music
- Foley

> In the description of the final scene of No country for old men how do the different aspects of sound design work together to create the scene?

After the crunch of impact, there are a few moments of what might be mistaken for stillness. The two cars rest smoking and crumpled in the middle of a suburban intersection. Nothing moves – but the soundscape is deceptively layered. There is the sound of engines hissing and crackling, which have been mixed to seem as near to the ear as the camera was to the cars; there is a mostly unnoticeable rustle of leaves in the trees; periodically, so faintly that almost no one would register it consciously, there is the sound of a car rolling through an intersection a block or two over, off camera; a dog barks somewhere far away. The faint sound of a breeze was taken from ambient sounds on a street like the one depicted in the scene. When Javier Bardem shoves open the car door, you hear the door handle stick for a moment before it releases. There are three distinct sounds of broken glass tinkling to the pavement from the shattered window, a small handful of thunks as he falls sideways to the ground, his laboured breathing, the chug of his boot heel finally connecting with the asphalt – even the pads of his fingers as they scrabble along the top of the window. None of these sounds are there because some microphone picked them up. They’re there because Lievsay chose them and put them there, as he did for every other sound in the film. The moment lasts about 20 seconds. No Country For Old Men is 123 minutes long.

> What is the sonic joke that Lievsay uses in all of his movies?

a particular car driving on a Manhattan street that sounds like cows mooing

> During the scene where Miles Ahead is mixed who are some of the people working on the production?

- picture editors
- directors
- producers
- actors - doing ADR
- and assistants

> What are some of the descriptors used for sounds on Miles Ahead?

stack, a field, a room, a series of colours. Noises were described as “washy”, “pingy”, “chunky”, “spongy”, “roomy”, “blatty” and “futzy”.

> What was the change that Lievsay made when Don Cheadle said that a scene was too dreamy?

He gave a woman who passed through the scene footsteps, suggesting a bustling in the room, causing it to seem more busy and less dreamy.

> And what category of sonic elements do those footsteps fall under?

Foley, after Jack Foley. Some Foley had already been created for the film that used the specific type of heel they were looking for so it didn't have to be recorded on the spot. Since her feet were not shown I think that the footsteps didn't have to be in sync with the woman passing through.

> What's the process of Foley mentioned in the article?

Costanzo’s job is to replicate every sound that might reasonably be produced in a film while his colleague, engineer George Lara, directs and records. Lara, tucked at one end of the warehouse in a sound booth, announces the cue to Costanzo (“skin on cloth”) and pulls up the clip for him. Costanzo watches once to rehearse, positions his two microphones to approximate the distance and reverb needed, and then does it for real, eyes locked on the screen. They work up from the easy things like “hand on hair” (for which Costanzo, bald as an egg, has a menagerie of wigs) to the harder cues: the sound of a tiger’s feet scraping wood or the sickening thwap-clunk of a gallows releasing.
