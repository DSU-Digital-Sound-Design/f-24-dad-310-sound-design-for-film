## Sound Worlds And Metaphors

{{% note %}}
We'll now go deeper into what sounds mean, how they can either deliver information directly or indirectly. Sound can refer directly, or metaphorically using one thing to refer to another.

But why use metaphor at all?

> A film only exists when it’s reflected in someone’s heart. That’s why I often sit in a cinema and watch some mindless thing on the screen and see people stare at it just as mindlessly, and I realize: this film does not even exist. It provokes no repercussions, no encounters.

---

> It’s a waste, not only of time. But if a film leaves the space for the spectator to dream himself or herself into it, to read ‘between the lines,’ to fill it with his or her own experiences and thereby make it come to life, then and only then it exists.
>

- Films are interactive experiences between the audiovisual material and the audience. Movies are not static objects, but come alive when viewed. 
- Overly simplistic, spoon-fed narratives tend to bore audiences. Viewers want to be challenged and intellectually engaged.
- Ambiguity and openness to interpretation make a film richer. By allowing space for the audience's imagination, a movie's meaning can expand in multiple directions. 
- The audience is an active participant in constructing the film's significance. Meaning is not inherent in the images/sounds alone, but arises through the interaction between the material and the viewer.

Ultimately, you argue that cinema is a collaborative endeavor between the filmmaker's craft and the audience's imagination. The filmmaker sets the stage, but the audience brings it to life by actively engaging with the meanings, symbols and ambiguities woven into the film. It's a compelling perspective on the nature of the cinematic experience. Let me know if I've accurately summarized your key points! I'm happy to discuss this idea further.

- Sound worlds can be
  - the domain of a **character, group, time or place** (wealthy elite, future, hell);
  - a **story theme** (social structure, technology, religion);
  - a side of a **narrative conflict** (rich vs poor, reality vs fantasy, life
    vs death).
- Created with aesthetic qualities of sound
  - pitch (low, high), rhythm (regular, irregular), timbre (bassy, bright), style (realist, hyperrealist, surrealist).

The previous example created a **sound world**. 

The concept of a "sound world" in film sound design refers to creating distinct auditory environments and aesthetics to represent different aspects of the story, characters, settings, themes, etc. Some key points:

- A sound world is a collection of signature sounds and auditory elements that immerse the audience in a specific mood, time period, location, or perspective.
- Sound worlds establish a sense of place, time, culture, or viewpoint through intentional choices in sound palette and design.
- They allow sound designers to stylize and shape the audience's emotional experience through audio, complementing the visuals.
- Effective sound worlds have cohesive internal logic and consistency even as they contrast with other worlds in the film.
- For example, a sci-fi film may have one sound world for the pristine spaceship interior and another grittier, industrial world for the city slums. 
- Or, a historical drama could differentiate between the elegant sound world of the aristocracy and the lively, chaotic world of the streets.
- Sound worlds help tell the story, communicate characters' inner states, and allow the audience to inhabit the fictional reality more fully through immersive audio.

- Their films like Eraserhead and The Elephant Man contain a high degree of ambiguity, leaving much open to interpretation. 
- Repeating industrial images/sounds form symbolic threads, often interpreted as representing dreams and the unconscious mind.
- The machine noises can be heard as metaphors for brain mechanics, with pitch manipulation giving a surreal, otherworldly feel. 
- This transports viewers to places defying straightforward meaning. 
- Cinematic symbols are used to explore mysterious territories where truth cannot be expressed literally.

In short, Lynch/Splet use metaphorical sounds and images as ambiguous, open-ended symbols to suggest the unconscious and evoke a dreamlike atmosphere of multiple meanings. Their films explore the limits of literal meaning through cinematic metaphor.

- Diegetic sounds are amplified and highlighted, yet often signify nothing. Dialogue is muted, creating "sonic discomfort". In Blue Velvet, mundane acts like lighting cigarettes are amplified to uncomfortable volumes.
  - Here we hear the sprinkler very loud

### Mulholland Drive (2001) - Scene: Club Silencio

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hoBUe-A2RkM?si=b-9OG2YXzmy1PoYN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Description: In one of the most famous scenes, Betty and Rita visit Club Silencio. A magician on stage announces that "there is no band" and that everything is an illusion. As the performer sings "Llorando," the audience hears a powerful, emotionally charged voice, but the singer is merely lip-syncing to a recording. The music continues even after the singer collapses, highlighting the disconnection between sound and what’s visually presented.

Ambiguity and Uncertainty: The soundscape creates an eerie, surreal atmosphere. The disjunction between what you hear and what you see represents the collapse of reality, a key theme in the film. The artificiality of the sound hints at the illusory nature of everything the audience has seen so far.

Philosophical Themes: The sound design here suggests that perception is unreliable and that the boundaries between reality, memory, and dreams are fluid. The audience is left questioning what is real and what is imagined, with sound amplifying this uncertainty.

### Scene: The Cowboy's Appearance

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd5HEJdcBwM?si=MVVspG--obh3Ojm_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Description: In this scene, when Diane meets the Cowboy in a dark room, the sound is unsettlingly quiet, with only minimal ambient noise. The Cowboy’s calm, deliberate speech is unnerving in its simplicity, and the absence of background music or noise adds to the tension.

Ambiguity and Uncertainty: The stark, minimalist soundscape increases the ambiguity of the Cowboy's role in the story. His voice, clear and distinct, contrasts with the eerie silence, making his words feel more like cryptic messages than direct communication. The sound here heightens the sense of foreboding and mystery.

Philosophical Themes: This scene reflects the film's exploration of fate and control. The Cowboy's words seem to carry hidden meaning, and the lack of sound around him creates an otherworldly presence, amplifying the feeling that something beyond human comprehension is at play.

## Twin Peaks 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFMaEIHIrGw?si=YYKT8OSW5oZxLXw3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}

- Extra-diegetic music by Angelo Badalamenti evokes nostalgia yet unease. In Twin Peaks, Badalamenti's synthesizer chords float ambiguously as extra-diegetic or "in the air" diegetic sounds. Musical cues undermine traditional rules of film scoring.

### Stalker (1979) - Scene: Entering the Zone


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgLqipD4E6M?si=1rGeq4LTBqfe28pE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


{{% note %}}
Scene: Entering the Zone
Description: As the characters enter the mysterious Zone, the soundscape shifts dramatically. The outside world is filled with industrial, mechanical noises and ambient background sound, but inside the Zone, these sounds fade, replaced by strange, almost unidentifiable noises—whispers, distant echoes, and subtle mechanical hums.

Ambiguity and Uncertainty: The silence and minimalistic sounds in the Zone evoke a sense of ambiguity. It’s unclear whether the sounds are real, imagined, or symbolic, and the environment itself feels alive, as if responding to the characters. This soundscape creates an atmosphere of tension, with uncertainty about the nature of the Zone itself.

Philosophical Themes: The Zone is often interpreted as a metaphor for human consciousness or desire. The ambiguous sound design reflects the uncertainty of the Zone’s power and its connection to the characters’ inner worlds, encouraging the audience to interpret its meaning through sound as much as through visuals.

### Scene: The Room and the Sound of Water

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPBuFheox7Q?si=irkmzdOhoaFssbyL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Scene: The Room and the Sound of Water
Description: In the final act, as the Stalker, Writer, and Professor approach the Room (where desires are supposedly granted), the sound of flowing water becomes more prominent. The consistent, ambient hum of water contrasts with the near silence around it. The sounds are subdued, yet they dominate the scene.

Ambiguity and Uncertainty: The flowing water, which could symbolize life or consciousness, adds a layer of uncertainty to the scene. Its constant presence is calming yet unnerving, as the significance of the Room and the consequences of entering it remain unknown. The water sound does not offer answers but deepens the mystery.

Philosophical Themes: The water could symbolize the fluid nature of reality and human desires, as well as the uncertainty that surrounds the Room’s power. The sound creates an atmosphere of contemplation, leaving the audience to ponder the Room's true nature and the philosophical implications of desire and fulfillment.

- His approach involved using sonic metaphors that matched the visuals, like spinning sounds for the spinners. 
- Director Denis Villeneuve had sound inform the edit from the start, allowing it to shape the final picture. 
- Instead of a music-driven score, they used "musical sound effects" to set mood and atmosphere.
- Editor Joe Walker describes their minimalist approach to music, relying more on sound design. 
- The sound team experimented to build complex futuristic audio landscapes.
- Mangini and re-recording mixer Ron Bartlett share insights into the creative sound process.
- The video emphasizes the vital role of sound design in sci-fi and the need to take risks and constantly educate yourself.
- Overall, it provides an inside look at how the team designed the dystopian sonic world of Blade Runner 2049.

### Scene: Opening in the City (K's Apartment)

Scene: Opening in the City (K's Apartment)

Description: Early in the film, we see K returning to his apartment after his mission. The soundscape is filled with mechanical hums, drones, and the constant hum of flying vehicles. There’s an overwhelming presence of industrial noise, which dominates the background. The artificial AI companion Joi adds another layer of synthetic sound to the environment.

Sound World: This scene epitomizes the industrial, dehumanized soundscape of the city. The omnipresent mechanical sounds reflect the cold, dystopian environment in which K lives, where human connections are scarce, and technology pervades every aspect of life.

Why it works: The oppressive, mechanical soundscape emphasizes the disconnection from nature and the dominance of technology in K's world. It heightens the theme of isolation in a city where human experiences are mediated through synthetic, manufactured realities.

### Scene: K's Pursuit in the City (Downtown Streets)

Scene: K's Pursuit in the City (Downtown Streets)

Description: As K navigates the crowded city streets during his investigation, the urban soundscape overwhelms the scene. We hear the roar of flying vehicles, advertisements blaring from holograms, and the constant background noise of crowds. The mechanical sounds of the city create a feeling of claustrophobia and sensory overload.

Sound World: This chaotic soundscape reflects the overwhelming, industrial environment of the dystopian city. The sounds of technology dominate the landscape, reinforcing the theme of human isolation in a city overrun by artificial constructs.

Why it works: The industrial sounds create a stark contrast with the quieter moments later in the film, showcasing the overwhelming nature of urban life in this dystopian future and emphasizing the dehumanizing effects of living in such an environment.

### Scene: K's Journey to the Ruins of Las Vegas

Scene: K's Journey to the Ruins of Las Vegas

Description: K ventures into the orange-tinted desert wasteland of the ruins of Las Vegas, seeking Rick Deckard. The soundscape becomes eerie and sparse, with only the wind and distant echoes filling the vast, empty landscape. The desolate environment is quiet and barren, with occasional faint sounds of debris blowing in the wind.
Sound World: This scene contrasts sharply with the urban sound world, as the sound of wind and the echoing emptiness take the place of the industrial noise. The barren soundscape reflects the isolation and loneliness of the landscape.
Why it works: The sparse sound design heightens the feeling of desolation and isolation, reflecting K’s own emotional state. The absence of noise is striking after the cacophony of the city, emphasizing the contrast between the artificial, chaotic city and the natural, desolate wasteland.

Scene: K's Confrontation with Deckard (Inside the Abandoned Casino)

Description: Inside the dilapidated casino, the sound world is filled with echoes and distant, muffled sounds. The abandoned space amplifies every footstep, and the occasional sound of broken glass or objects being knocked over echoes through the empty halls. The eerie silence contrasts with the mechanical, industrial sound world of the city.
Sound World: The quiet, empty space reflects the long-abandoned nature of this once-bustling location. The desolate soundscape enhances the feeling of isolation and decay.
Why it works: The isolation of the sound design reflects both Deckard’s self-imposed exile and K’s internal struggle. The empty, reverberating sound world contrasts with the densely packed, chaotic city, emphasizing the theme of desolation in this new setting.

**Why These Scenes Work Together:**
The contrast between the urban dystopia scenes and the desolate wasteland scenes serves to emphasize the film’s core themes of artificiality versus nature, technology’s dehumanizing effects, and the profound isolation that pervades both environments. While the city is loud, chaotic, and synthetic, the wasteland is eerily quiet, vast, and empty, representing two extremes of human experience in a futuristic world. The sound differences not only create a powerful visual and auditory contrast but also underscore the emotional and philosophical journey of the characters.

## Sound Worlds - Parasite

- [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/2fd691a0-f66b-467f-8635-00d7f151f3d4)
  - poor families home - start - 6:00
  - Rich people's home - 12:36 - onwards

{{% note %}}
Here's a summary of the key points about the use of sound design in Parasite to contrast the rich and poor families:

- Sound designer Ralph Tae-Young Choi developed distinct sound aesthetics for the two families' spaces.
- The poor family's home is subjected to aggressive outside noises - dogs, cars, neighbors. This represents their lack of barriers from the external world. 
- In the wealthy home, only gentle natural sounds like birdsong enter. Lavish reverb gives interior sounds a sense of openness and scale.
- Doors and gates were emphasized in the sound design. Their sounds represent the division between haves and have-nots. 
- Overall, the contrasting use of invasive versus expansive, harsh versus gentle sounds helps establish the differences between the families' living conditions, resources, and insulation from the outside world.
- The sound design provides auditory metaphors for inequality and the boundaries between rich and poor.

Here is a bullet point summary of the key points:

- Sound worlds in a story must provide tension but ultimately be reconcilable. They can't be too similar or too
- Parasite fuses its contrasting social worlds within the same space, providing an inventive resolution.
- Force Majeure uses contrasting sounds of the resort interior (soft, predictable) and exterior storms (bassy, angular) to depict conflicting worlds. 
- A striking intercutting scene has the family innocently brushing teeth, interspersed with shots of an explosive snowstorm. 
- This audible contrast builds dramatic irony and a sense of two worlds about to collide that only the audience understands.
- Overall, the film uses contrasting sound worlds to reveal the brittle foundations beneath the family's facade of perfection.
- The aesthetic collisions create tension and lead to pivotal revelations.
