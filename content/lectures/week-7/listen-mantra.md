## Editing Mantra L-I-S-T-E-N Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Listen Critically

Play the audio file and listen carefully. Does it sound good? Are there any noticeable problems, such as clicks, pops, or other errors? If the audio quality is poor, consider deleting it and starting over. If the quality is good but has some errors, proceed to fix them in the next steps.

### 2. Identify Clicks, Pops, and Errors

Listen for clicks, pops, or errors in the audio. Use your editing software to identify and remove these issues. You can manually locate the offending waveforms and delete them, or use a noise reduction tool to clean up the file.

### 3. Signal Process (EQ and Compression)

Apply equalization (EQ) and compression to enhance the sound quality. Use EQ to balance the frequency spectrum and remove unwanted noise. Apply compression to manage the dynamic range and ensure a more consistent sound.

### 4. Trim/Crop the File

Trim or crop the audio file to remove unwanted silence at the beginning or end. This step also includes cutting out any sections that are unnecessary or do not contribute to the final product.

### 5. Examine Fade-Ins/Fade-Outs at the Zero Line

When adding fade-ins or fade-outs, make sure they begin and end at the zero line. This prevents clicks or pops during playback, ensuring smooth transitions.

### 6. Normalize/Name File

Normalize peaks to -0.5 dB to keep audio levels consistent across files. Note that ambiences or sound beds do not need to be normalized this high; peak levels between -18 dB and -6 dB are acceptable for these types of sounds. Finally, name the file descriptively, and embed metadata with expressive keywords for easier categorization.
