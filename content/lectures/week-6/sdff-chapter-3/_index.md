## Ambience

- **Beds** - continuous layers of sound, providing a foundation for the rest of the sounds within a scene
- **Details** - can be used as fleeting elements to punctuate the soundscape at particular moments.

{{% note %}}
These layers of sounds we usually ignore but would miss if they were gone.

We can go back to the first chapter and talk about ambience in 3 different catagories:

- Schafer
  - Sounds of the Earth (for example, whistling wind, creaking glaciers, rumbling volcanoes). - **geophony**
  - Sounds of non-human life (for example, chirping insects, warbling birdsong, howling wolves). - **biophony**
  - Sounds of humanity (for example, clanging industry, babbling voices, beeping machines). - **anthrophony**

### Beds - Wuthering Heights (2011)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mop7madxCbM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the 2011 version of Wuthering Heights, **the natural elements are used in place of a score**, giving the film a bleak but evocatively evolving tone. As director Andrea Arnold recalled, ‘When I was up on the moors I felt the wind was like music.’

Here are some ways the 2011 film version of Wuthering Heights uses ambient sounds:

- Wind is used frequently throughout the film to evoke the gloomy, windswept Yorkshire moors where the story is set. Howling wind establishes mood and atmosphere.
- Nature sounds like birds chirping, bees buzzing, and running water help bring the rural setting to life. These quiet sounds are juxtaposed with the blustery wind.
- Creaking doors, cracked windows, and floors accentuate the eerie vibe of the old farmhouses.
- Footsteps on wooden floors and gravel paths help mark character movements and transitions between scenes.
- The crackling fireplace signifies the warmth of domestic spaces contrasted with the cold moors.
- Farm animals like cows and horses can be heard faintly in the background, highlighting the agricultural setting.
- Rain and thunderstorms heighten the drama and Gothic tone during climactic scenes.
- Music fades in and out of ambient sounds rather than starkly beginning/ending, seamlessly blending mood.

Overall, ambient sounds are used thoughtfully in the film to establish a strong sense of place and augment the mood and emotions of each scene. The sounds ground the story in its remote rural setting.

### Details - The Elephant Man

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sF19L00KbAI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This technique is seen at work in The Elephant Man’s iconic train-station scene, in which the protagonist’s escalating situation is underscored by the sounds of off-screen trains that increase in tempo and intensity, creating a dramatic emotional trajectory.

- Diegetic train sounds - The rumbling, hissing, and screeching of the trains coming and going create an oppressive, overwhelming ambience. The loud trains emphasize the horror John Merrick feels.
- John's labored breathing - We hear every pained wheeze and gasp through John's distorted mouth, amplifying his respiratory distress.
- John's muffled cries - As he is knocked down and trapped by the crowd, John's whimpers are muted, conveying his helplessness.
- Rumbling crowd noise - The indistinct roar of the mob heightens the chaotic, nightmarish tone. Individual voices are drowned out. 
- Music crescendo - The score builds in intensity as John struggles, then cuts out abruptly when he is rescued, providing dramatic relief.

Through expressive sound design, Lynch creates an audio landscape that externalizes John's internal panic and disorientation in the scene effectively. The sounds are essential in generating sympathy for him.

## Room Tones

> the ‘dead air’ of an indoor space, the sound that remains when there is no action.

- Bathroom - <audio src="room-tone/room tone bathroom windy vent.wav" controls>
- Hallway - <audio src="room-tone/room tone hallway heavy ventilation and electrical machinery.wav" controls>
- Large library - <audio src="room-tone/room tone large room library.wav" controls>
- Stairway - <audio src="room-tone/room tone stairway 1.wav" controls>

{{% note %}}
- **Room Tone Coloration with EQ:**
  - Adjust EQ to change the room tone's character.
  - Higher frequencies can create a cooler and clinical effect.
  - Cutting extreme highs and lows reduces hiss and rumble.
- **Pitch Shifting for Character:**
  - Duplicate a single frequency tone layer for pitch shifting.
  - Pitch shift adds emotional character.
- **Emotional Associations with Pitch Shifts:**
  - Major third (four semitones) or perfect fifth (seven semitones) for positivity.
  - Minor third (three semitones) for sadness.
  - Diminished fifth (six semitones) or single semitone for dissonance (useful in horror).

### Eraserhead

We can also create tones using sustained music notes, pitched up or down to blend with the other layers. If our chosen sound works with the image and has the right atmosphere for the scene, we need not worry about motivating it in terms of a source within the room. In fact, many films make no attempt at realism within the room tones. **This is the case with many horror and science-fiction films, or in the crackling and rumbling domestic spaces of Eraserhead, for example.**

In Eraserhead, Lynch uses drone sounds to create a sense of unease and dread throughout the film. The constant presence of the drone sounds creates a feeling of tension and anxiety in the viewer. This is heightened by the fact that the drone sounds are often associated with negative images, such as the factory, the baby, and Henry's nightmare.

Lynch's use of drone sounds in Eraserhead is one of the many ways that he creates a sense of unease and dread in the film. The drone sounds are unsettling and disorienting, and they contribute to the overall atmosphere of the film.

### Domestic Spaces 
- **Appliances** - Humming of refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, etc. Creates an ambient drone.

A sound designer can reflect the inner life of a subject through the sounds of their home in the following ways:

- Objects and technology: The types of objects and technology that a person chooses to fill their home with can reveal a lot about their personality and interests. For example, a person with a lot of musical instruments or books might be creative and introspective, while a person with a lot of sports equipment or video games might be more outgoing and active.
- Radio and TV: The radio station that a person listens to and the TV shows that they watch can also reveal a lot about their personality and interests. For example, a person who listens to classical music and watches documentaries might be more intellectual and cultured, while a person who listens to pop music and watches reality TV might be more down-to-earth and fun-loving.
- Ambience: The overall ambience of a home can also reflect the inner life of its subject. For example, a cold and reflective space might suggest that the subject is withdrawn and introverted, while a warmer and more inviting space might suggest that the subject is open and extroverted.

Sound designers can use all of these elements to create a soundscape that reflects the inner life of a subject. For example, they might use harsh, metallic sounds to represent a character who is angry and aggressive, or soft, soothing sounds to represent a character who is calm and peaceful.

**Should the outside world break into the room with the character or not?**

## World coming in

For example, in the film "Taxi Driver," the sound of the city outside Travis Bickle's cab reflects his inner turmoil. The noise and chaos of the city represent the violence and alienation that he feels.

## World kept out

In other cases, it might make sense to keep the outside world out of the room with the character. This could be done to create a sense of isolation and claustrophobia, or to show how the character is shutting out the outside world.

* Jack Torrance is in the Overlook Hotel's Gold Room, typing on his typewriter.
* He is completely focused on his work and oblivious to the world around him.
* The sound of the typewriter is all that can be heard.
* The camera pulls back to reveal the rest of the Gold Room, which is large, empty, and silent.
* The camera pans across the room, showing the empty chairs and tables.
* The camera returns to Jack's face, who is still completely focused on his work.
* The sound of the typewriter fades out, and the scene ends in silence.

This scene is effective because it creates a sense of isolation and claustrophobia. The viewer feels trapped in the Gold Room with Jack, and they are just as unaware of the outside world as he is. The silence is also very effective, as it highlights the tension and suspense of the scene. The scene also reflects Jack's inner state of mind, as he is completely obsessed with his work and has shut out the rest of the world.

In 1996, the Japanese government designated ‘100 Soundscapes of Japan’, in an effort to protect certain well-loved acoustic environments against the threat of noise pollution. The chosen sounds, such as the ship whistles at Yokohama Port, insects singing in Oshikiri and the squeaking sand of Kotogahama Beach, bring a unique character to their location, just as the chimes of Big Ben serve as a shorthand for London.

One of the most iconic sounds in Blade Runner is the sound of the rain. The rain is constant and relentless, and it creates a sense of gloom and despair. The sound of the rain is also used to create a sense of isolation, as it drowns out all other sounds.

### Son of Saul

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZMuLU94HTc?start=4125" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The scene mostly focus's on the main character's face 

The opening scene in the movie "Son of Saul" uses soundscape to convey the camp's atrocities in the following ways:

* **The scene opens with the sound of screaming.** This immediately sets the tone for the film and gives the viewer a sense of the horror that is to come.
* **The screaming is accompanied by the sound of barking dogs and gunfire.** This creates a sense of chaos and confusion, and it suggests that the viewer is witnessing something terrible.

The soundscape in the opening scene of "Son of Saul" is incredibly immersive and realistic. It helps to create a sense of immediacy and intimacy for the viewer, and it conveys the atrocities of the concentration camps in a way that is both visceral and emotional.

The use of sound in this scene is particularly effective because it is not over-the-top. The sound of the screaming, the barking dogs, the gunfire, the buzzing flies, and the burning ovens are all sounds that would have been present in a real concentration camp. This makes the scene feel more authentic and believable, and it makes the atrocities of the camp more real for the viewer.

The opening scene of "Son of Saul" is a powerful and disturbing depiction of the Holocaust. The soundscape plays a vital role in conveying the atrocities of the camp, and it helps to create a film that is both unforgettable and emotionally resonant.

### Hunger

Hunger takes a different approach to extension, with a soundscape that barely expands the frame. Telling the story of Bobby Sands’ fatal hunger strike in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland, designer Paul Davies avoids the typical background of off- screen shouts and cell-door slams, instead focusing on the claustrophobia of the cell itself. This works to bring us into the character’s singular, extremely determined perspective, as we come to terms with the profound price he is willing to pay.

The sound design in Steve McQueen's 2008 film Hunger is used to great effect to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension. The film tells the story of Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), a member of the Irish Republican Army who went on a hunger strike while imprisoned in Maze Prison in Northern Ireland.

The film is shot in a very confined space, and the sound design reflects this. The sound of the prison walls is constantly present, and it serves as a reminder of the characters' confinement. The sound of the other prisoners can also be heard, but it is muffled and distant, which creates a sense of isolation.

The film also uses silence to great effect. There are many scenes where there is no dialogue or sound effects, and this silence serves to highlight the characters' loneliness and despair.

Here are some specific examples of how the sound design in Hunger emphasizes the claustrophobia of the prison:

* In the opening scene of the film, the viewer can hear the sound of the prison walls echoing. This creates a sense of confinement and claustrophobia.
* In the scene where Sands is being force-fed, the viewer can hear the sound of the feeding tube going down his throat. This is a visceral and disturbing sound, and it emphasizes the brutality of the force-feeding process.
* In the scene where Sands is dying, the viewer can hear the sound of his breathing becoming increasingly labored. This is a heartbreaking sound, and it emphasizes the suffering that Sands is going through.

The sound design in Hunger is one of the many things that makes the film so powerful and disturbing. It helps to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension, and it emphasizes the brutality and inhumanity of the prison system.

### Rear Window

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9lZRDAoecs?start=172" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}

* Highly subjective narratives, taking place in extreme environments and employing suitably bold modes of conveying setting.
* Most films demonstrate a mix of approaches, with the level of extension being varied to suit each moment.
* Michel Chion describes this effect in Rear Window, a film in which the action is entirely viewed from an apartment overlooking a courtyard.
* Visual approach contrasted by a dynamic use of ambiences.
* Chion says that ‘Sometimes it lets us hear the big city thrumming outside this courtyard that the film never leaves. At other times the sound track eliminates the larger cityscape entirely, so as to reconcentrate the spectator on the apartment itself...At the very end of the film, the extension becomes extremely narrow, focusing on a single point, like a lone spotlight pursuing a character on a stage.’

**Summary:**

Chion is describing how Hitchcock uses sound in Rear Window to create a sense of both immersion and detachment for the viewer. The sounds of the city outside the apartment can be heard at times, but they are often muted or muffled, which creates a sense of isolation. This is contrasted with the sounds inside the apartment, which are often very clear and detailed. This contrast between the two soundscapes helps to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension, as the viewer feels both trapped in the apartment with Jeff and connected to the world outside.

In the final scene of the film, the sound of the city outside disappears completely, and the viewer is left with the sound of Jeff's breathing and the sound of the rain. This creates a sense of intense focus and suspense, as the viewer knows that Jeff is about to confront the killer.

Chion's description of the sound design in Rear Window is a good example of how sound can be used to create a sense of setting and atmosphere in film. The sound design in Rear Window helps to create a sense of both immersion and detachment for the viewer, and it contributes to the overall suspense and tension of the film.
