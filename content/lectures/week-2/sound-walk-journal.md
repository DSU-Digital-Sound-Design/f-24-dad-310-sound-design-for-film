title: "Sound Walk Journal Assignment"
---

#### **Objective**  
To experience and analyze the environmentâ€™s soundscape through the perspective of a film sound designer. Students will take notes during the walk and later reflect on how sounds can be used to enhance storytelling in a film.

---

#### **Step 1: Preparation**  
- **Location:** We will walk together as a class in a quiet location, such as a park, urban area, or nature trail.
- **Materials Needed:** A notebook, pen, and (optional) smartphone for recording notes or sounds.
- **Focus:** You are listening for sounds that could be used in a film soundtrack to represent reality or emotional subtext.

---

#### **Step 2: During the Walk**  
**Walk Silently**  
 - Walk as a group, maintaining silence to better focus on listening to the soundscape.
 - Pay attention to the **layers** of sound around you. Focus on both natural and human-made sounds, noting **volume, rhythm, pitch, and texture**.

**Take Notes**  
 - As you walk, take notes on the different sounds you hear.  
 - **Categorize** them into:  
   - **Background sounds** (ambient noise, distant traffic, birds chirping)  
   - **Mid-range sounds** (footsteps, rustling leaves, conversations)  
   - **Foreground sounds** (prominent or sudden sounds like a dog barking or a door slamming).

**Emotional Impact**  
   - As you listen, note the **emotional effect** of each sound. Does a certain sound make you feel calm, anxious, nostalgic, etc.?  
   - Think about how the sound might be used in a film to create a specific **mood or tone**.

#### **Step 3: After the Walk**  

**Edit Your Notes**  
   - After the sound walk, take time to edit and organize your notes.  
   - Make sure your sound categories (background, mid-range, and foreground) are clear.  
   - Reflect on any sounds that stood out to you and why.
  
**Answer Reflection Questions**  
   - Once your notes are organized, respond to the following reflection questions:
     - **Which sounds stood out to you the most, and why?**
     - **How did the overall soundscape make you feel?**
     - **If you were designing a soundtrack for a film scene based on your walk, which sounds would you highlight, and why?**
     - **What types of sounds might you eliminate or alter to enhance the emotional or narrative focus of a scene?**
     - **How could the layering or interaction of sounds help tell a story?**
  
**Submission Options**  
   - You may choose to submit your reflection in one of two formats:
     - A **written reflection** answering the questions in detail.
     - A **voice recording reflection** where you verbally discuss your thoughts and answers to the reflection questions.
