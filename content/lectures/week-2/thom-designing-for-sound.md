# Designing for Sound by Randy Thom

## Introduction

In *Designing for Sound*, Randy Thom explores the critical role that sound plays in filmmaking, challenging the common misconception that sound design is merely about creating impressive sound effects. Instead, Thom argues that sound should be an integral part of the filmmaking process, influencing and interacting with other creative elements from the earliest stages of production.

## What is Sound Design?

Thom begins by emphasizing that sound design goes beyond crafting sound effects. He illustrates this with examples from *Star Wars* and *Apocalypse Now*, where sound was not just an add-on but a driving force that shaped the films as much as the visuals did.

> *Thom’s main point in the first paragraph is that sound, music, and dialogue should interact with visuals throughout production, shaping the film and making sound an integral part of the storytelling process.*

He criticizes the current state of sound design in many movies, where "great sound" is often equated with loudness rather than being part of a dynamic and evolving experience that resonates with the visuals and other sensory elements.

> *Thom’s issue with sound design in many movies today is that it’s often reduced to high-fidelity recordings of explosions and effects rather than being part of a dynamic continuum that enhances the overall sensory experience.*

## A Thing Almost Alive

Thom argues that sound and music should not merely react to the visuals but should actively influence them, creating a more cohesive and living filmic experience. He questions why, in such a collaborative medium, sound rarely has the opportunity to influence other aspects of filmmaking.

### Sound as a Narrative Device

Sound can tell a story in ways that visuals alone cannot. Thom emphasizes that sound can reveal information about characters, settings, or emotions that aren't explicitly shown on screen. This idea ties into the concept of "subtext" in sound design, where sound conveys underlying themes or emotions. 

- **Film Clip Example**: *Inception* (2010) by Christopher Nolan uses sound motifs, particularly Hans Zimmer’s score and the manipulation of "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien," to represent the different levels of dreams.

## The Basic Terrain, As It Is Now

Thom outlines some of the challenges faced by sound designers, such as the late consideration of sound in the filmmaking process. He suggests that sound should be thought of from the scriptwriting stage and throughout pre-production to ensure it contributes effectively to the storytelling.

### Pre-Production

Thom notes that the potential for sound to contribute to storytelling is determined more by the use of time, space, and point of view (POV) in the script than by specific sound cues. The best sound sequences often align with POV sequences, where the audience experiences the story through the character's sensory experiences.

> *Thom mentions that the best sound sequences in films are typically POV sequences, where the audience experiences the action through the character's perspective.*

### Collaboration Between Sound and Visual Teams

Thom argues for better collaboration between the sound team and other departments, like cinematography and production design. Early collaboration can lead to more innovative and cohesive storytelling. One excellent example of this is David Fincher’s *The Social Network*, where tightly integrated dialogue and sound design reflect the intensity and pace of the film.

### Production

On set, sound considerations are often neglected in favor of visuals. Thom points out that sets are usually designed without sound in mind, leading to noisy environments that complicate sound recording. He advocates for more thoughtful collaboration between departments to enhance the sound design.

### Post Production

Sound design often enters the process late, with composers and sound editors being given limited time to produce and integrate sound elements effectively. Thom criticizes this approach, arguing that it forces sound to be reactive rather than a proactive part of the storytelling.

> *ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) is necessary when the production dialogue is unusable due to noise or other issues. Thom suggests that the ADR process is often rushed and lacks the energy of the original performances.*

### Use of Silence

Silence can be a powerful tool in sound design, creating tension, highlighting specific sounds, or giving the audience space to reflect on the narrative. This idea is well-executed in films like *No Country for Old Men* or *A Quiet Place*, where silence plays a crucial role in building tension and atmosphere.

## Taking Sound Seriously

Thom challenges the notion that film is a primarily visual medium, arguing that sound is equally important in creating a cinematic experience. He urges filmmakers to take sound seriously and to consider its impact from the beginning of the project.

> *Do you agree with Thom's assertion that film is not primarily a visual medium?*

## Writing For Sound

Thom stresses the importance of writing with sound in mind, particularly in establishing POV. He argues that the script should lay the groundwork for how sound will be used to enhance the story, rather than leaving it as an afterthought.

> *According to Thom, the most important aspect of writing for film is establishing POV, as it allows the audience to experience the action through the characters' senses.*

We'll skip some of Thom's detailed suggestions for scriptwriting, but his overall message is clear: sound should be an integral part of the storytelling process from the very beginning.

## Visual Techniques that Enhance Sound Design

Thom discusses several visual techniques that can complement sound design:

- **Extreme Close-ups and Long Shots**: These shots provide opportunities for sound to express the character's perspective or to emphasize the vastness or emptiness of a setting.
  - **Long Shot** - [Lawrence of Arabia](https://youtu.be/HlUFxO0wxVQ?si=JvkspdHORuQg58rd)
  - **Close Up** - [The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly](https://youtu.be/aJCSNIl2Pls?si=4HNc2FUka_-WMcpo)
- **Slow Motion**: Used in films like *Raging Bull*, slow motion can create a dreamlike state that invites unique sound treatments.

- **Sound and POV in *Saving Private Ryan***: The opening battle scene in *Saving Private Ryan* is a prime example of using sound to immerse the audience in the chaos of war. The use of muffled sounds and the high-pitched ringing after explosions place the audience in the soldier's experience.
  - **Film Clip Example**: [Saving Private Ryan - Omaha Beach](https://youtu.be/hdBEyitJ7Qc?si=C9kYkYYGNie9a4_Z) 
- **Subjective Sound in *Black Swan***: Darren Aronofsky’s *Black Swan* uses subjective sound to convey the protagonist’s psychological state. The sound design shifts from diegetic to non-diegetic as the protagonist’s mental state deteriorates, creating a sense of unease.
  - **Film Clip Example**: [Black Swan - The Transformation Scene](https://youtu.be/mCmY7Q8wwts?si=A_EZC_RkeZOwLKM3) 

## Sound's Talents

Thom lists the various roles sound can play in a film, from setting a mood and indicating a geographical locale to defining a character and smoothing transitions. He emphasizes that sound should be more than just a functional element; it should have its own life and contribute meaningfully to the story.

- According to Thom, sound can:
  - Suggest a mood or evoke a feeling
  - Set a pace
  - Indicate a geographical locale or historical period
  - Clarify the plot or define a character
  - Connect otherwise unconnected ideas or moments
  - Heighten or diminish realism, ambiguity, or transitions
  - Describe an acoustic space
  - Startle or soothe the audience

In conclusion, Thom advocates for a more integrated approach to sound design, where sound is not an afterthought but a central part of the filmmaking process, influencing and enhancing every other aspect of the film.

## Activity: Scene Analysis

To reinforce these concepts, students will analyze a selected scene where sound plays a critical role. Break down how sound elements contribute to the scene's overall impact, focusing on elements like mood, pacing, and character development.
