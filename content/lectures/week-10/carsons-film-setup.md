title: "Organizing and Preparing a Film Sound Project in Reaper"
---



When working on a film sound project setting up your Reaper project in a clear and organized way is essential. In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps needed to organize and prepare your project for ADR, location audio cleanup, Foley, SFX, and mixing. Following this workflow will make it easier to manage your sound elements and allow for more flexibility as you edit and mix.

### 1. **Set Up Your Project in Reaper**

- **Start a New Project**&#x20;
- **Import Video and Location Audio:** Import the video file, and since the location audio is embedded, duplicate the video track to create a separate audio track for editing later. Make sure to set the project’s frame rate and sample rate to match the video to avoid sync issues.

### 2. **Organize Tracks and Labeling**

- **Create Tracks for Each Audio Type:** Set up individual tracks for ADR, Foley, SFX, ambiance, and location audio.
- **Separate Location Audio by Character**:
  - To improve organization and editing efficiency, split the location audio track by character. For each character, create a dedicated track (e.g., “Character\_A\_Dialogue,” “Character\_B\_Dialogue”) and move their dialogue clips to the correct track. This setup allows for individualized audio processing and makes ADR replacement easier.
- **Color Code for Quick Identification:** Color coding can help you quickly recognize the types of audio on the timeline. For example, make all ADR tracks one color, Foley another, and so on.
- **Scene Regions:** Create regions for each scene or section of the film. This helps keep track of which scene you’re working on, especially when you start adding layers of Foley, SFX, and other audio elements.

### 3. **Clean Up Location Audio**

- **Noise Reduction and EQ:** Use Reaper’s built-in ReaFIR for noise reduction on each character’s track, if needed. If ReaFIR isn't sufficient, consider using iZotope RX for more advanced noise reduction. Then, apply EQ to shape each character’s voice for clarity.
- **Adjust Volume and Apply Compression:** Balance the volume of each track to ensure dialogue clarity, and add light compression to manage volume inconsistencies.

### 4. **Prepare and Record ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement)**

- **Add ADR Cues for Each Character:** Identify sections needing ADR and place them on dedicated ADR tracks for each character. This lets you mute location audio just for these specific segments, leaving other dialogue intact.
- **Record ADR in Sync with Visuals:** Record ADR in sync with the visuals to match lip movement accurately. Use loop recording and playback to capture multiple takes until you get the best match.
- **Timing and Pitch Adjustments:** Use Reaper’s “Stretch Marker” or “ReaPitch” if slight adjustments are needed to align the ADR with visuals perfectly.

### 5. **Add Foley Effects**

- **Set Up Foley Tracks and Organize by Type:** Create separate tracks for each Foley sound type, such as footsteps, clothing rustles, and prop sounds, and label these tracks clearly. Keeping Foley organized will make mixing easier later.
- **Record in Sync:** To capture accurate Foley effects, record each sound effect in sync with the film actions. You can use Reaper’s “Time Selection Auto Punch” mode to record individual sections without overwriting other parts.

### 6. **Add Sound Effects (SFX)**

- **Create Empty Clip Placeholders for SFX:** Add empty clips to the timeline for any SFX that need to be added later. This will help keep track of where SFX should be inserted.

Record SFX where possible or find suitable effects in a library if recording is not practical. Use placeholders for any SFX that will be added later to ensure all effects are accounted for during editing.

### 7. **Add Ambiance and Environmental Sounds**

- **Include Background Ambiance:** Add room tone or environmental sounds (e.g., city noise or forest ambiance) for a sense of continuity and realism.
- **Looping and Automation:** For ambiance that needs to loop, add fades to the end of each loop to ensure smooth transitions. Automate volume changes based on scene shifts to maintain a natural flow in the audio.

---

### 8. **Final Mixing and Mastering**

- **Balance Audio Levels:** Adjust the volume levels of each track (dialogue, Foley, SFX, ambiance) to ensure a cohesive and balanced mix. Dialogue should remain clear, with other elements complementing rather than overpowering.
- **Add Effects for Cohesion:** Light reverb and EQ can help blend ADR, Foley, and location audio for a unified sound. Avoid over-processing, keeping the sound natural and true to the scene.
