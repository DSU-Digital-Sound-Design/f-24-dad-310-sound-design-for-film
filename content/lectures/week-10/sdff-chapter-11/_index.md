# Space

## Acoustics, Silence And The Frequency Spectrum

---

## Spatial Features

- Acoustic space
- Frequency spectrum
- Negative space

---

## Acoustic Space

- Acoustic Space refers to how sound exists within and interacts with a physical or perceived environment in film:
  - *Blade Runner 2049*: Cavernous sounds reflect Wallace's isolation
  - *Das Boot*: Tight audio enhances submarine claustrophobia
  - *Inception*: Dream levels differentiated by unique acoustic spaces

{{% note %}}

- *Blade Runner 2049* uses vast, empty acoustics to represent Wallace's isolation and god-like perspective.
- *Das Boot* uses confined sound design to emphasize submarine life’s claustrophobia.
- In *Inception*, deep echoic sounds in dream layers create surreal, layered spaces, helping viewers track narrative levels.
- Each example shows how sound shapes emotional engagement with cinematic spaces.

## Acoustic Elements: Echo, Reverb, and Resonance

- **Echo**: Adds distance, reflecting space and isolation
- **Reverb**: Persists sound, enhancing space and emotional tone
- **Resonance**: Builds specific frequencies to add depth

{{% note %}}

- Echo and reverb create spatial depth and realism by simulating sound reflections off surfaces.
- Resonance amplifies certain frequencies, adding psychological weight or tension to scenes.
- Each element enhances the film’s setting and conveys emotional undertones beyond visual scenes.
- Sound designers use these tools to immerse audiences in a realistic or stylized auditory environment.

- Setting: Large hall creates a sense of vastness and emotional distance
- Reverberation: Voice echoes emphasize separation
- Emotional Impact: Reverberation persists even up close, reinforcing relational tension

{{% note %}}

- The hall setting emphasizes the space’s physical and metaphorical scale, with characters distanced by both sound and placement.
- The continued reverb when they speak close underlines their emotional disconnect.
- The use of sound transcends space to depict relational isolation, making sound a narrative device in the scene.

## Acoustics in Film: Echo

- Echo reflects sounds, creating depth and realism
- Originates from Greek myth of Echo
- Creates effects of grandeur, isolation, or introspection in film soundscapes

{{% note %}}

- Echo is a repeated sound reflection, which varies with surface distance and material.
- Mythological inspiration comes from Echo, who could only repeat words, tying to sound's persistent qualities.
- Echo is often used to enhance feelings of loneliness or importance in scenes, shaping the viewer’s perception of the space.

## Reverberation (Reverb)

- Reverb involves multiple echoes decaying over time
- Influenced by room size, surface distance, and reflectivity
- Adds realism to indoor spaces or natural environments in sound design

{{% note %}}

- Reverb’s “tail” effect, where echoes decay, creates a sense of room size and material texture.
- Used indoors or in urban spaces, reverb varies to convey intimacy, distance, or atmosphere.
- Well-known for creating immersive effects, like in *The Shining*, where reverb evokes the Overlook Hotel's supernatural vibe.

- Enhances specific frequencies, creating psychological depth
- *Dunkirk*: Bass tones sustain tension and fear in wartime scenes
- *Sicario*: Low-frequency resonance amplifies suspense in border crossing scene
- *There Will Be Blood*: Resonant tones emphasize character's ambition and turmoil

{{% note %}}

- *Dunkirk* sustains tension with resonant bass, immersing viewers in war's immediacy.
- *Sicario*’s low resonance adds weight and tension during the border crossing, increasing viewer unease.
- *There Will Be Blood* uses resonance to underscore the character’s psychological state and ambition.
- Resonance in sound amplifies mood and tension, creating an immersive emotional response.

- Process: Recording playback to capture room’s acoustic properties
- Outcome: Speech transforms into a "droning mush," capturing the room's sound identity

{{% note %}}

- Lucier records his voice and replays it into the room multiple times, a process that blends voice with the room’s acoustics.
- Over cycles, words dissolve into resonance, showcasing the room’s unique acoustic character.
- This piece explores the idea of the room as an active sound component, blending art and acoustic science.
