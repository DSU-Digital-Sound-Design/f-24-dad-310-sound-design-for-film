  * Listen to your surroundings and use headphones to identify any noise.
  * Raise the gain until you hear noise, then reduce it until the noise disappears.
  * For quieter ambiences, such as in a forest, keep the levels between -50 and 20 dB. 
  * For louder ambiences sounds, such as traffic or construction, keep the levels around -12 dB. We keep the level lower so that if a a louder sound comes by so it won't ruin the recording. 
  * For loud sounds, such as sound effects, keep the levels between -6 dB and -3 dB.
  * If you are unsure about the levels, it is better to err on the side of caution and record at a lower level.
