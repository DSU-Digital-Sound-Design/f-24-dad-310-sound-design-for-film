**Assignment 1: Live Foley Performance**

For this assignment, **you will work in a team of three (or two)** to perform live Foley for the provided animation. Your goal is to recreate the sounds you imagine for the robot in real-time, just like how Jack Foley had to synchronize sound effects live with visuals.

### Key Considerations:
- **What sound sources do you use?** Think about the materials the robot consists of. Consider the surface it stands on. Imagine the mechanisms within the metal that form its "skin." Reflecting on these will help you choose the appropriate objects for your live Foley performance.
- **Team organization:** You may organize your work in any way you see fit. If each group member is responsible for the sounds of the various robot parts, you should be able to cover the entire character. 
- **Bring the robot to life:** The word "animation" comes from the idea of "bringing to life." Consider what types of sounds will further convey an impression of life and integrate these into your live performance.

### Project Requirements:
- **Live performance only**: This assignment is focused on performing the Foley live. You will not be recording the sounds in this project—that will come in the next assignment.
- **Duration**: The animation is 10 seconds long, and you need to create Foley effects for all animation events that make sound during this time.
- **Any sound-making objects are fair game**: Be creative with the objects you choose for your live Foley performance.
- **Evaluation**: You will be graded on the quality of your live performance, the synchronization with the animation, and your teamwork. Be sure to rehearse as a group so that your performance is well-coordinated.

### Tips for Success:
- Practice your timing: Since you’ll be performing live, it’s important to practice syncing your Foley actions with the events in the animation.
- Prepare your Foley objects in advance: Think carefully about which objects will work best for each sound and rehearse with them.
- Communicate with your team: Effective teamwork is crucial for a smooth live performance.
