### Final Project Overview

Your final project will be to craft a comprehensive five-minute sound design piece. This project serves as an opportunity to apply your skills and creativity to produce a professional-grade soundtrack. You may choose one of the following two options for your sound design:

1. **Original Short**: Create a sound design for an animated or live action short film.  
2. **Feature Film Scenes**: Select three contrasting scenes from a feature film to design your sound design. 

Here are some options:

- Also find some great shorts on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/categories)

Your final submission should integrate all elements of sound design that we've discussed throughout our course. Each sound design must include the following components:

### Foley
- **Recording Live Foley**: Endeavor to record as much live foley as you can, capturing the essence of the characters through the sounds of their interactions with the world.
  - **Types of Foley**:
    - *Moves/Cloth*: Any sounds associated with the characters' movements or their clothing.
    - *Footsteps*: The sounds made by characters' movements across various surfaces.
    - *Specifics/Spots/Props*: Distinctive sounds that objects make in the environment, directly related to the characters' interactions.
  - Use studio equipment for in-house sounds, and a portable zoom recorder for those that need to be captured outside the studio setting.

### Ambiences
- **Ambience Tracks**:
  - *Beds*: These are your continuous sound layers that act as the foundation of your scene.
  - *Details*: These are momentary sounds that add texture and depth at key moments within the scene.
- **Indoor/Outdoor**: Fabricate authentic ambiences appropriate to your scene's setting.
  - *Room Tone*: For indoor scenes, use a room tone to establish the space's auditory environment.
  - *Outdoor Sounds*: Include earthly, human, and non-human life sounds as we've explored in previous weeks.

### Miscellaneous Sound Effects (SFX)
- For all other on-screen elements that do not fall under dialogue, foley, or ambience.

### Final Mix
The final mixdown is crucialâ€”it's where you balance and blend all the elements to achieve harmony and the intended emotional impact.
- **Dialogue**: Start with the dialogue tracks if you're using them. The overall levels should average between -12 dB to -6 dB. Utilize compression to maintain consistency in the dialogue's dynamic range.
- **Integrating Foley, SFX, and Ambience**: Once the dialogue sits well in the mix, incorporate the foley, followed by other SFX, and finally, the ambiences.
- **Reverb and Panning**: Use reverb SENDs to unify the sound elements by placing them in the same acoustic space. Employ panning and its automation to match the sounds to the on-screen action spatially.
- **Impulse Responses**: To assist in creating realistic acoustic environments, utilize additional impulse responses available [here](https://www.voxengo.com/impulses/).
