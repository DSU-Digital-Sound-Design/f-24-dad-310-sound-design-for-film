## Overview
Download the video [here](../HardSurface_robot_animation-346689615.mp4)

This 10-second animation features a robot playing with a rubber duck. Your challenge is to create believable mechanical sounds that match the robot's movements while conveying personality and rhythm.

Working in teams of three (or two) from Assignment 1, use Reaper to **record** and **layer** Foley sound effects for the animation.

## Project Requirements
1. Cover all sound-making objects and events in the 10-second animation.
2. Demonstrate high-quality recordings, precise synchronization, and a well-balanced final mix.
3. Submit a zipped (compressed) archive of your entire DAW session, including all audio and video files, to D2L by the due date.

# Holistic Rubric: Studio Foley Recording Assignment

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| A (90-100%) | The Foley work demonstrates exceptional creativity and technical skill. Sounds are of high quality, perfectly synchronized with the animation, and effectively bring the multi-armed robot and rubber duck to life. The mix is well-balanced, with clear distinction between different sound elements. The overall sound design significantly enhances the viewing experience. |
| B (80-89%) | The Foley work shows good creativity and technical competence. Most sounds are of good quality and well-synchronized. The multi-armed robot and rubber duck are represented effectively, with only minor issues in timing or sound choice. The mix is generally well-balanced, and the sound design noticeably improves the animation. |
| C (70-79%) | The Foley work demonstrates adequate creativity and technical ability. Sound quality and synchronization are generally acceptable, with some noticeable issues. The multi-armed robot and rubber duck are represented, but some sounds may be generic or lack detail. The mix has some imbalances, but overall supports the animation. |
| D (60-69%) | The Foley work shows limited creativity or technical skill. There are significant issues with sound quality, synchronization, or sound choice. The multi-armed robot or rubber duck may be poorly represented sonically. The mix has noticeable imbalances that detract from the viewing experience. |
| F (0-59%) | The Foley work fails to meet basic standards of quality and creativity. Sounds are of poor quality, poorly synchronized, or inappropriate for the animation. The multi-armed robot and rubber duck lack convincing sound representation. The mix is imbalanced and detracts significantly from the animation. |
